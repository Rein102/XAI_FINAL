repository for final project of xai

Download loan_approval.py. install libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, dice
Download dataset and put in same folder or change path to dataset
Adapt preprocessing steps if necessary and if different dataset is used
Separate feature and target variables into desired variables
Split into train and test set, test size can be changed by altering 'test_size'
Train randomforestclassifier. If different model is selected, different preprocessing might be needed (e.g. scaling variables)
Print evaluation metric of choice (e.g. accuracy score)
Create model and select instance of counterfactual, including which counterfactual is desired (e.g. opposite)
Visualize counterfactuals.
